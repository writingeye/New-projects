      "original message: Poetry (derived from the Greek poiesis, making), also called verse,[note 1] is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and often rhythmic[1][2][3] qualities of language − such as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metre − to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, a prosaic ostensible meaning. A poem is a literary composition, written by a poet, using this principle. Poetry has a long and varied history, evolving differentially across the globe. It dates back at least to prehistoric times with hunting poetry in Africa and to panegyric and elegiac court poetry of the empires of the Nile, Niger, and Volta River valleys.[4] Some of the earliest written poetry in Africa occurs among the Pyramid Texts written during the 25th century BCE. The earliest surviving Western Asian epic poetry, the Epic of Gilgamesh, was written in Sumerian. Early poems in the Eurasian continent evolved from folk songs such as the Chinese Shijing, as well as religious hymns (the Sanskrit Rigveda, the Zoroastrian Gathas, the Hurrian songs, and the Hebrew Psalms); or from a need to retell oral epics, as with the Egyptian Story of Sinuhe, the Indian epic poetry, and the Homeric epics, the Iliad and the Odyssey. Ancient Greek attempts to define poetry, such as Aristotle's Poetics, focused on the uses of speech in rhetoric, drama, song, and comedy. Later attempts concentrated on features such as repetition, verse form, and rhyme, and emphasized the aesthetics which distinguish poetry from more objectively-informative prosaic writing.   encypyted message:  Pligvh (oivxyio kvla gmi Gviiu blxidxd, aruxzs), rcdl erccio yivdi,[zlgi 1] xd r klva lk cxgivrgfvi gmrg fdid ridgmigxe rzo lkgiz vmhgmaxe[1][2][3] nfrcxgxid lk crzsfrsi − dfem rd bmlzridgmigxed, dlfzo dhaqlcxda, rzo aigvi − gl iylui airzxzsd xz rooxgxlz gl, lv xz bcrei lk, r bvldrxe ldgizdxqci airzxzs.
